    "content": "**Clause 3: Lease Term and Automatic Renewal**\n\nClause 3 states:\n\n\"2. The lease is granted for a term of 11 months, automatically renewable unless the Lessor objects in writing.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis clause outlines the initial lease term and the conditions for its automatic renewal. The lease is initially granted for 11 months. After this period, the lease will automatically renew unless the Lessor (the property owner) sends a written objection to the Lessee (the tenant). This means that if the Lessor does not object in writing, the lease will continue indefinitely.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Initial lease term: 11 months\n* Automatic renewal: unless Lessor objects in writing\n* Lessor's objection: must be in writing to prevent automatic renewal\n\n**Implications:**\n\nThis clause is important because it affects the duration of the lease and the Lessee's rights to continue occupying the premises. If the Lessor does not object in writing, the Lessee may continue to occupy the property indefinitely, which could have implications for the Lessee's long-term plans and financial commitments."
