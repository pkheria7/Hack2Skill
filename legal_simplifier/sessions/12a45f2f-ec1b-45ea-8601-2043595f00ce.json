    "content": "**Understanding the Payment Terms**\n\nYou're having trouble understanding the payment terms outlined in the lease agreement. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Clause 4: Payment Terms**\n\nClause 4 states:\n\n\"4. The Lessee shall pay a monthly rent of \u20b925,000, payable only in cash.\"\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* The Lessee must pay a fixed monthly rent of \u20b925,000.\n* The rent must be paid in cash, which means you cannot pay it through any other means, such as:\n\t+ Bank transfer\n\t+ Credit card\n\t+ Check\n\t+ Online payment platforms\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\nThis clause is crucial because it outlines the specific payment terms for the Lessee. If you fail to pay the rent in cash, it may be considered a breach of the lease agreement. This could lead to consequences such as:\n\n* Termination of the lease\n* Legal action\n\n**Example:**\n\nTo illustrate this, let's say you receive a notice from the Lessor asking you to pay the rent. However, you try to pay it through a bank transfer. In this case, you would be in breach of the lease agreement because the rent must be paid in cash.\n\n**Reiterating the clause:**\n\nClause 4 is clear and specific about the payment terms. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.\n\n**Related clause:**\n\nIf you're wondering about the security deposit, Clause 5 states:\n\n\"5. The Lessee shall pay a security deposit of \u20b95,00,000, non-refundable under any circumstance.\"\n\nThis clause is related to the payment terms because it mentions a separate payment that the Lessee must make. However, it's essential to note that the security deposit is non-refundable, whereas the monthly rent is a recurring payment."
