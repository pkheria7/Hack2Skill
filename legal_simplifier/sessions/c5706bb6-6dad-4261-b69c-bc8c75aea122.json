The Lessee shall pay a security deposit of \u20b95, 00, 000, non-refundable under any circumstance.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis clause requires the Lessee (you, as the renter) to pay a security deposit of \u20b95,00,000 (five hundred thousand rupees). The key term here is \"non-refundable,\" which means that you will not get this amount back, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n**Analogy:**\n\nThink of a security deposit like a safety net for the Lessor (the property owner). If you cause any damage to the property or fail to fulfill your obligations, the Lessor can use this deposit to cover the costs. Since it's non-refundable, you won't get it back even if you're a responsible tenant.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nBe aware that you'll be paying a significant amount upfront, and it will not be returned to you under any circumstances."

The Lessee shall pay a security deposit of \u20b95, 00, 000, non-refundable under any circumstance.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe security deposit is a one-time payment made by the Lessee (you) to the Lessor (the property owner). This amount is set at \u20b95,00,000 (five hundred thousand rupees). The key term \"non-refundable\" means that you will not receive this amount back, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n**What does \"non-refundable\" mean?**\n\nIn simple terms, \"non-refundable\" means that the Lessor gets to keep the security deposit, even if you:\n\n* Pay your rent on time\n* Take good care of the property\n* Move out without causing any damage\n\n**Why is the security deposit non-refundable?**\n\nThe Lessor may keep the security deposit as a safety net in case you cause any damage to the property or fail to fulfill your obligations. This way, the Lessor can use the deposit to cover the costs of repairs or other expenses.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nBe aware that you'll be paying a significant amount upfront, and it will not be returned to you under any circumstances. This means you should carefully consider your financial situation and the potential risks before signing the lease.\n\n**Relevant Clause:**\n\nClause 5 is the primary clause governing the security deposit."
